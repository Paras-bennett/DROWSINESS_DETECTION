# DROWSINESS_DETECTION
Drowsiness of the driver causes the majority of accidents. So using Python, OpenCV, and Keras we will build a system that wil prevent these accidents and alert the driver when he feels sleepy.
The objective behind this project is to develop a Driver sleeping alert system that could find if
a person had closed his/her for a longer period of time. If system find eyes to be closed for
some seconds than the system will sound an alarm to alert the driver.
